When building LLVM, you also build the lit driver, llvm-lit, as part of the default build target or
the check target

llvm-lit location - ${LLVM_BUILD_PATH}/bin/llvm-lit

Example command - ./bin/llvm-lit test/CodeGen/AArch64/GlobalISel/


llvm-lit command Option Effect

    -s  Silent: Only print a progress bar and the final report
    -v  Verbose: Print the RUN lines and the output of a test on failure
    -a  Print all: Same as verbose but for all tests, not just the failing ones


When using lit directly, you may want to make a habit of using the following command:
$ ./bin/llvm-lit -sv <tests>
